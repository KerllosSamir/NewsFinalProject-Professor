He also was supposed to have been checked in on by a guard every 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nBefore his downfall, Epstein had previously counted many prominent rich and powerful people, including Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, as friends.',5,'articleImages/p07jyzfs.jpg',1,1,1),(6,'Super Cup: Liverpool and Chelsea to meet in final - why you should care','Super Cup:\r\n    Liverpool v Chelsea, Istanbul (Wednesday, 20:00 BST)\r\nHow to follow:\r\n Listen on BBC Radio 5 live; text commentary on the BBC Sport website\r\nThe Uefa Super Cup takes centre stage on Wednesday with Champions League winners Liverpool taking on Europa League victors Chelsea at the Besiktas Park in Istanbul.\r\nIt is a big opportunity for one of these two sides to win their first piece of silverware this season, but just how much should you care about the game?\r\nHere are five reasons why it is a fixture worth your time.\r\nThe Super Cup has effectively made its home in the trophy cabinet of a Spanish club in recent years, with the past five winners all from Spain.\r\nBut it will, for the first time in 14 years, be heading to England this year, with this game being the first time it has been contested between two Premier League sides.\r\nIn total seven Super Cup finals have been between domestic rivals - five involving Spanish teams, including four since 2014, and two all-Italian ones.\r\nFrappart is already accustomed to making history. In April, she became the first woman to take charge of a French domestic men\'s Ligue 1 match when she was the referee for the game between Amiens and Strasbourg. She has been included in the pool of referees for the 2019/20 Ligue 1 season.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Frappart was the referee for the Women\'s World Cup final between the Netherlands and the USA and on Wednesday will lead a team made up mostly of female officials. Manuela Nicolosi from France and the Republic of Ireland\'s Michelle O\'Neill will be the assistant referees.',7,'articleImages/_108296361_livchelsea.jpg',1,1,1),(7,'Biostar security software \'leaked a million fingerprints\'','More than a million fingerprints and other sensitive data have been exposed online by a biometric security firm, researchers say.\r\nResearchers working with cyber-security firm VPNMentor say they accessed data from a security tool called Biostar 2.\r\nIt is used by thousands of companies worldwide, including the UK\'s Metropolitan Police, to control access to specific parts of secure facilities.\r\nSuprema, the firm that offers Biostar 2, said it was addressing the issue.\r\n\"If there has been any definite threat on our products and/or services, we will take immediate actions and make appropriate announcements to protect our customers\' valuable businesses and assets,\" a company spokesman told the Guardian.\r\nAccording to VPNMentor, the exposed data, discovered on 5 August, was made private on 13 August.\r\nIt is not clear how long it was accessible.\r\nAs well as fingerprint records, the researchers say they found photographs of people, facial recognition data, names, addresses, passwords, employment history and records of when they had accessed secure areas.\r\n\r\nBiostar 2 was only used at the company\'s head office in Stoke on Trent, IT director Colin Hampson said.\r\nHe said that since 26 February 2018 Tile Mountain had not been an \"active client\" of Suprema\'s and had instead stored biometric data on its own secure internal servers.\r\n\"Despite Tile Mountain not being an active client of Suprema it is concerning that no contact was made to inform us that data may have been compromised - this could potentially have prevented Tile Mountain from carrying out its obligations under GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation],\" he added.',2,'articleImages/_108308854_gettyimages-485453875.jpg',1,1,1),(8,'23 ancient cities that have survived more than just time','In the 12th century, the Khmer took their vast understanding of the known universe and sought to recreate it in miniature.\r\nThe result was Angkor Wat, a sprawling city designed to impress with meticulously arranged moats and towers, and walls covered in astonishingly detailed bas reliefs of Hindu deities.\r\nThe ancient Khmer took a broad view of scenes worth preserving. \r\nWhile many are celestial or holy in theme, other murals detail mundane acts like preparing supper.\r\nAngkor Wat stretches over 500 acres within the Angkor Archeological Park, a large area covering more than 150 square miles.\r\nThe main temple receives packs of tourists, but many lesser-known temples offer a chance to wander through old Khmer capitals, which were built from the 9th century onwards.\r\nRome, Italy\r\nVisiting a city as beloved as Rome comes with particular hazards: the crowds, the cheesy souvenirs, the young men in full gladiator regalia waiting to pose for selfies with tourists.\r\nAnd yet there are few places like it.\r\nTake the Colosseum -- a nearly 2,000-year-old stadium in the middle of a modern city.\r\nIn the days of actual gladiators, 50,000 spectators would gather with the emperor for bloody contests to the death.\r\nThe Colosseum had the original retractable roof, a whizz-bang contraption called a velarium that used sail technology to rig canopies to shelter crowds from sun and rain.\r\nAnd we\'ve not even mentioned the Vatican, the catacombs or the Forum.\r\nIstanbul, Turkey\r\nIstanbul loves to depict itself as the city straddling two continents.\r\nWhat\'s most remarkable is the way the city straddles great periods of history that pile up and fold over themselves more naturally than anywhere else in the world.\r\nConstruction by successive empires from Byzantium to Constantinople to modern Turkey have bequeathed Istanbul an instantly recognizable skyline that merges elements from all those eras.\r\nIn the historic core around the iconic Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine-era Hippodrome circus sits a short stroll away from the Ottoman Empire\'s Topkapi Palace, which houses artifacts including Moses\'s staff.\r\nSurrounding it all is a thriving modern city with top-notch dining, galleries and architecture that make Istanbul one of the world\'s most important cultural centers.',1,'articleImages/http _cdn.cnn.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_130426143821-unesco-angkor-wat.jpg',0,0,1),(10,'\'Sunnyside\' and \'Bob â¤ Abishola\' highlight immigrant experiences with humor and heart','In the new NBC series \"Sunnyside,\" Kal Penn plays a washed-up New York City politician who begins to tutor US immigrants on how to pass their citizenship test.\r\nThis rag-tag class is a melting pot of cultures. Joel Kim Booster and Poppy Liu play privileged children of a mysterious (probably evil) mastermind. Samba Schutte plays an Ethiopian doctor who won a citizenship lottery and is now a cab driver. Moses Storm plays a young person who was brought here as a toddler. And Diana Maria Riva plays a hard-working Dominican with a seemingly endless resume of thankless jobs. One thing they all share is an all-too-real fear of deportation.\r\nYet, despite how much this premise sounds like it was ripped from the headlines as melodramatic bait for anti-immigration proponents -- especially given Penn\'s history of working for the Obama administration\'s Office of Public Liaison -- \"Sunnyside\" is a half-hour comedy.\r\nSo, how is this political powder keg of a premise handled exactly?\r\n\"Our entire writing staff, with the exception of one person, is either an immigrant themselves or a child of an immigrant,\" Matt Murray, who created the series with Penn, explained when CNN asked earlier this month during a conference at the show\'s Television Critics Association press day. \"We are just getting real stories.\"\r\nHe added that the path to citizenship is \"an infuriating process\" and \"we are trying to tell, sort of, a bunch of different stories around the subject. It\'s not one specific thing to everyone. So we are just trying to tell real stories about people who have gone through it, and, yeah, there is comedy to be mined.\"',4,'articleImages/190814105501-sunnyside-super-169.jpg',0,0,1),(11,'Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry\'s diversity problem','Last month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide \"momentum\" for its \"existing diversity and inclusion approach.\"\r\nThe move marked Chanel\'s entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.\r\nAbout two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to \"create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity.\" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.\r\nPrada pulls products after accusations of blackface imagery\r\nThese announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry\'s response to accusations that it\'s out of touch with customers and society at large.\r\nIn the past year alone, Gucci has come under fire for retailing a $790 turban, a garment with religious significance for Sikhs; Dolce & Gabbana was accused of racism after it portrayed a Chinese model attempting to eat Italian food with chopsticks; and Burberry was accused of glamorizing suicide after it presented a hoodie featuring an elaborate knotted drawstring that resembled a noose. Meanwhile, Prada merchandise and Katy Perry shoes have both blithely referenced blackface caricatures.\r\nThese missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry\'s noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci\'s turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G\'s ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.\r\nHiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion\'s troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.\r\nTeen Vogue\'s fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask, \"why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?\"',6,'articleImages/http _cdn.cnn.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_190307151944-gucci-blackface-sweater-new.jpg',0,0,1),(12,'Dandyism: This global style movement offers a view on black male identity','A hot pink tie with matching spectacles. A bright blue turban photographed against multicolored wallpaper. A pair of orange socks peeking out from beneath plaid trousers.\r\nSimple flourishes like these have the power to turn an otherwise unremarkable outfit into an unforgettable one.\r\nThey certainly caught the eye of American curator and critic Shantrelle P. Lewis, who included photos of such details in her book \"Dandy Lion: The Black Dandy and Street Style,\" a visual archive of a career spent studying the history of dandyism within black communities.\r\nThough dandyism is most associated with early European figures like Lord Byron and Oscar Wilde, who used their dress to establish themselves as intellectual and artistic forces, black men in the United States have used clothing as a means of distinction since the days of slavery, when freed slaves would dress in their best garments to exercise a privilege not afforded to those enslaved.\r\nUnseen photos provide a sensitive look at America\'s early \'working girls\'\r\nSince its origins, dandyism has evolved to influence a number of social and cultural movements within black communities around the world. The identity is no longer associated with just one country, gender or sexual orientation, but rather has become an anchor point for self expression.\r\nWhen describing Grammy-nominee Janelle MonÃ¡e\'s relationship to dandyism and inclusion in her book, Lewis explains: \"Fluidity occurs throughout all forms and spectrums of dandyism.\"\r\nIn 2010, Lewis looked at how contemporary black men were continuing that legacy of sophisticated dress in \"Dandy Lion,\" a small photography exhibition staged at a pop-up gallery in Harlem. Since then, she has expanded the exhibition into a global movement called \"The Dandy Lion Project,\" a traveling multimedia showcase for black photographers and filmmakers who have captured stylish dressers around the world.\r\nThe author\'s book is an extension of the exhibition, divided into sections that introduce micro movements, groups and individuals that have emerged as a result of dandyism throughout history.\r\nThe Swenkas, for instance, are a group of working-class Zulu men in South Africa who began hosting fashion competitions as a means of displaying wealth and rebelling against apartheid. The contests have strict rules regarding how the men must dress and what colors they should sport.\r\n\"The Swenka movement became a nonconfrontational protest and resistance against the oppressive and racist regime,\" Lewis writes.',8,'articleImages/http _cdn.cnn.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_190722132126-05-dandy-lion.jpg',0,0,1),(13,'Thousands are trapped in a desert settlement in Syria, near a US military base','Shukri Shehab and his wife have not slept in two nights. Their three-week-old granddaughter will not stop crying. She needs simple medicine for bloating, Shehab says, but it is nearly impossible for them to find.\r\nShehab lives in Rukban, an informal settlement for Syria\'s displaced people in a US-protected zone in southern Syria, roughly 10 miles away from an American military base. Shehab has been communicating with CNN over the last four months.\r\nFor more than 1,200 days, Shehab says he and his family have lived in this cluster of shelters sprinkled along a stretch of desert on the Syrian-Jordanian border. Activists dubbed it the \"Triangle of Death.\" The United Nations called conditions \"desperate,\" \"catastrophic\" and \"no place for a child.\"\r\n\r\nFor years, the displaced in Rukban have been at the mercy of proxy powers and political players, leaving them with sporadic access to humanitarian aid and no safe way home. And for the past five months, the Syrian government has blocked humanitarian access to the encampment through its territories.\r\nNo side is taking responsibility for these people,\" says Aron Lund, a Syria expert and fellow at the Century Foundation, a non-partisan think tank.\r\nA State Department official tells CNN the US is \"pursuing every possible avenue to deliver aid to Rukban.\" But so far Washington has not directly provided aid to the tens of thousands stuck in the settlement, even though the US has protected the area since 2016.\r\nThe US has pinned the blame solely on the Syrian government and its Russian allies. Damascus has denied requests for aid deliveries to Rukban since February, pushing instead for civilians to return to regime-controlled areas.\r\n\"Rukban is another example of the Assad regime\'s consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,\" Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Sean Robertson told CNN in a statement.

Tests of the liquid inside returned a \"presumptive positive result for methamphetamine,\" the Australian Border Force said in a statement.\r\nThe investigation has been referred to the Australian Federal Police.\r\n\"Our officers work tirelessly to prevent these harmful drugs from making it into Australian communities, and I\'m proud of the results they continue to achieve,\" border force regional commander Danielle Yannopoulos said. \"The ABF has invested heavily in our technological capability in recent years and we can see further into every package than ever before.\"',1,'articleImages/190726135806-02-meth-snow-globes-exlarge-169.jpg',0,0,1),(15,'The US Army is developing AI missiles that find their own targets','Artificial intelligence may soon be deciding who lives or dies. The US Army wants to build smart, cannon-fired missiles that will use AI to select their targets, out of reach of human oversight. The project has raised concerns that the missiles will be a form of lethal autonomous weapon â a technology many people are campaigning to ban.\r\n\r\nThe US Armyâs project is called Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munition (C-DAEM).

Yet, speaking in an Instagram live video on Wednesday as he travelled to Mexico City to film an advert, the 29-year-old WBO, WBA and IBF champion claimed that details of the rematch had yet to be announced.\r\nI know everybodyâs talking about the fight and all but we got the real news coming soon,â he said. âThe fight is going to happen soon. Iâm trying to give hope, give motivation to all my people.â\r\n\r\nAsked about hosting the rematch in the USA, Ruiz Jr said: âOf course. Itâs going to be on my terms, our terms, weâre going to bring it back here in the United States.â\r\n\r\nThose comments were given short shrift by Hearn who claimed that the man who stopped Joshua in the seventh round at Madison Square Garden in New York at the start of June would have to honour their deal.\r\n\r\nâThe contract for the rematch was signed prior to the first fight,â he told Sky Sports. âThey are both signed at the same time. There is no other contract. We have to let him know the time, date and venue which we have done. Thatâs it. They are contractually bound for the rematch.\r\n\r\nâThere are no conversations between the two teams about not doing the fight. I donât perceive a problem. He signed a contract with us that he was absolutely over the moon with, that gave him the opportunity of a lifetime. He will 100% honour that contract.â\r\n\r\nHearn added: âHis choice is to have a legal battle that could put him out of boxing for years, or to defend his belts for a lot of money against a guy he has already beaten. There isnât any doubt he will take the fight.\r\n\r\nâAny messing around and Ruiz Jr will lose belts and he wonât want to do that. We expect the IBF, WBA and WBO belts to be on the line. There are mandatories due but, in our opinion, Ruiz Jr is within his rights to have a voluntary defence. That defence is against Anthony Joshua.â\r\n\r\nIf the rematch does eventually take place, one interested observer will be Tyson Fury. The 31-year-old will take on Otto Wallin, an unheralded Swede, in his next bout in September but predicted Ruiz Jr would repeat his victory over Joshua.\r\n\r\nâIt was all about Joshua at that time when he was fighting Ruiz; nobody gave Ruiz a prayer,â Fury said. âBut now itâs about Ruiz and I believe Ruiz does exactly the same the second time round',7,'articleImages/3950.jpg',0,0,1);
